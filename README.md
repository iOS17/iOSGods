## What is the iOSgods app?

The iOSGod app is a massive collection of tweaked apps. This allows users to install unique modded IPA apps, games, tweaked apps, jailbreak apps, and more freely. Also, users can take an iOSGods VIP version, which allows an online signing option to install apps. Users with an Apple developer account can also use this app without signup. 

The free app allows users to download the iPA files of the updated games, tweaks, and jailbreak apps. So users can download the apps in an IPA format and then sign it with the sideload (Pc Tool) like the app. The sideload needs a PC to sideload the IPA files instead of. If you want to install apps directly, you can use [Esign patch](https://zeejb.com/esign-app/), [Feather](https://zeejb.com/feather-ios/), or [9 Installer ](https://zeejb.com/9-install%d0%b5r/)like on the device iPA signer.

## How to install App Via iosGods

### Normal Install
This option will normally install the .deb file supplied. Just like Filza. It will support any deb files and always be reliable since it uses dpkg under the hood. iGameGod will attempt to convert rootful to rootless or vice versa if necessary before installation.

### Install/Inject via iGameGod
This is the new option introduced which will use iGameGod to inject the .deb file(s) supplied. This option will use iGameGod to inject the tweaks which nicely bundles all your tweaks inside the new iGameGod Installed Tweaks category in Tools. Another perk of this feature is that it also helps against detection some apps use. iGameGod will attempt to convert rootful to rootless or vice versa if necessary before installation.
